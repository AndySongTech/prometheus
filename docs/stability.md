# API Stability Guarantees

Prometheus promises API stability within a major version, and strives to avoid
breaking changes for key features. Some features which are cosmetic, still
under development, or depend on 3rd party services are not covered by this.

Things considered stable for 2.x:

* The query language and data model
* Alerting and recording rules
* The ingestion exposition format
* JSON HTTP API (used by dashboards and UIs)
* Configuration file format (minus the service discovery remote read/write, see below)
* Rule/alert file format
* Console template syntax and semantics

Things considered unstable for 2.x:

* Any feature listed as experimental or subject to change, including:
  * The [`holt_winters` PromQL function](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/issues/2458)
  * Remote read, remote write and the remote read endpoint
  * GRPC APIs
* Service discovery integrations, with the exception of `static_configs` and `file_sd_configs`
* Flags
* Go APIs of packages that are part of the server
* HTML generated by the web UI
* The metrics in the /metrics endpoint of Prometheus itself
* Exact on-disk format. Potential changes however, will be forward compatible and transparently handled by Prometheus

That not everything is considered stable does not mean that we will break
things for fun, rather that we may have to make breaking changes as Prometheus
evolves or as bugs are discovered. Any breaking changes will be marked as
`CHANGE` in release notes.
